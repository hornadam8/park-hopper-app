Park Hopper is a Sinatra Web application that allows users to login and view
information on any national park. Users can additionally log a "trip" to any
national park by adding a visit date and review from a form on the park page.
These trips are viewable on the users profile page.

To see this application at work, clone this repository, access its directory
from your terminal and run bundle install, then shotgun. The site will be visible at localhost:9393.
